# This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting heart failure risk with an accuracy of 90%. By applying advanced techniques like SMOTE for imbalanced data, L1 regularization for feature selection, and a stacked classifier for performance enhancement, this model offers improved prediction accuracy and precision in identifying high-risk patients, supporting timely medical interventions.

Key Features
SMOTE for Imbalanced Data: Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance and improve the prediction of high-risk cases.
L1 Regularization: Used L1 regularization to select the most relevant features, enhancing the interpretability and performance of the model.
Stacked Classifier: Employed a stacked classifier to improve prediction accuracy, outperforming existing models in heart failure risk assessment.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Core language for developing the machine learning model.
Scikit-learn: For implementing SMOTE, L1 regularization, and stacked classification.
Pandas & NumPy: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: This is used to visualize the importance of features and model performance.
